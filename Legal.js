/* ============================================================
   BSF Saudi Legal Case Workbench — Standard WebApp (JS component)

   Companion to backend.py and style.css. Responsibilities:
     * hold the whole translation catalogue ported from legal_ui.py,
       because the backend deliberately returns keys rather than
       localised labels;
     * render every view from the JSON the backend serves;
     * drive the async job endpoints and their progress reporting;
     * wire every button, form, upload, tab and search box.

   No business logic lives here. Every legal decision, persistence
   write and document render is a backend call.
